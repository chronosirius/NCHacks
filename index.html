  <p class = "WebsiteDescription">What our website is about:<br><br>
    We created this website for the NorCalHacks Competition. We coded a
    
    website which gives you easy
    
    access to information
    
    about land and sea animals in
    
    the form of flip cards. 
  
    We chose this as our project 
  
    as thinking about the theme, 
    
    we thought land and sea animals
    
    fit the topic perfectly.</p>
